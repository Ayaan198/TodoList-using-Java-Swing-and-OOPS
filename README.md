# 🗂️ Task Manager GUI - Java Swing Project

A desktop-based Task Manager application built using **Java Swing**, designed to help users manage tasks with essential details like **name**, **deadline**, and **priority**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📋 Add, view, and manage tasks
- ⏰ Set deadlines and assign priorities
- 🎨 User-friendly GUI using `JFrame`, `JTextField`, `JButton`, and more
- ✅ Real-time updates using event-driven programming (`ActionListener`)
- 🔁 Internal task storage using `ArrayList`
- 💡 Built using clean object-oriented principles (encapsulation, inheritance)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied

- **Java Swing** for building GUI
- **Object-Oriented Programming**  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Inheritance  
- **Exception Handling**
- **Event-Driven Programming**
- **Java Collections** (`ArrayList`) for storing and managing tasks
